# A transparent SIRD model for COVID19 death projections in India

We are a group of 2 students from IIT Delhi who, observing the rapidly worsening COVID19 crisis in India, recognized the urgent need to come up with effective mitigation strategies. To stress this point, we developed an SIRD compartmental model to predict the spread of the disease in India. We believe that any modelling strategy is only as good as its assumptions. Therefore any honest attempt at modelling must strive to be as transparent as possible so that the community can easily replicate and examine the projections and assumptions involved. 

## Model details

An SIRD model is a type of [compartmental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology). Compartmental models partition the population into group or _compartments_. An SIRD is a simple of compartmental model which has just four compartments. We encourage you to read about our model in detail in this [whitepaper](https://github.com/anag004/covid-model/blob/master/ihme/whitepaper.pdf) we have released.
